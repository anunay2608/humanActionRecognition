The study illustrates an E3D architecture constructed by scaling a two-dimensional EfficientNet design to three dimensions. E3D is a basic yet effective network that makes use of a unique Depthwise 3D convolution layer on which the whole method is based. By using and expanding EfficientNetB0, a depthwise convolution layer is designed for comprehending spatial and temporal information for a large-scale processed frame sequence dataset. The 101 different actions from two publicly accessible action categorization datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101, are summarised in one uniform design. The book goes on to discuss how E3D works and how its learned features outperform existing state-of-the-art classification benchmarks in terms of performance, efficiency, and deployment characteristics, reaching 98.74% and 86.49% accuracy on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, respectively.
